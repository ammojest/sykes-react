                    <p className="mx-7 w-3/4 text-center text-copy">Our business began in Manchester in 1862 by Joseph Sykes, by the trading in wet fish and Dutch Shrimp â€” a miracle to previous generations. At this time, fresh fish was merely obtainable at seaside ports, so to a city like Manchester, fish was only available if preserved by smoking or salting. By the mid-19th century, with the development of Britain&quot;s rail network and speed of international transport, vast quantities of ice could now be transferred from Canada. J. Sykes seized this opportunity by purchasing ice from ice salesman to store fresh fish. Like the swell of the waves, Sykes Seafood has no intention of standing still. We have been established since 1862 and in 2020 our desire & passion for the industry we operate within, remains as strong as ever. As with all great adventures the best is yet to come. Our company, including it is dedicated workforce, continue to grow and the unequalled quality of our products and customer service gets even better with the passage of time.</p>
