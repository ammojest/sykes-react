                <p>The terms of the Contract shall apply to any replacement Goods supplied by Sykes.</p>
                <p>Due to the perishable nature of the Goods, save as provided for in

                <p>Title to the Goods shall not pass to the Customer until Sykes receives payment in full (in cash or cleared funds) for the Goods or until the Customer takes possession of the Goods (whichever is later).</p>
                <p>Subject to Condition 6.4, until title to the Goods has passed to the
                Customer, the Customer shall:&nbsp; store in accordance with Sykes oral or written instructions (including at the relevant storage temperature) or, if no such instructions are provided by Sykes, in accordance with good trade practice for storing perishable goods
                of the same nature as the Goods;&nbsp; not remove, deface or obscure any identifying mark or packaging on or relating to the Goods;  maintain the Goods in satisfactory condition and keep them insured against all risks for their full price from the date of delivery; notify Sykes immediately if it becomes subject to on Insolvency Event; and give Sykes such information relating to the Goods as Sykes may require from time to time.</p>

The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.</p>
                <p>If the Customer fails to make any payment due to Sykes under the Contract by the due date for payment, then without prejudice to Sykes’ other rights and remedies, Sykes may at its
                discretion suspend processing any Order (whether or not such Order forms part of the Contract to which the default payment relates, or a separate Contract with the Customer) until such time as it receives payment of the outstanding amount in full from the Customer.</p>
                <p>The Customer shall pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (except for any deduction or withholding required by law).
