                <p>We recognise that data security breaches are increasingly common occurrences, whether these are caused through human error or via malicious intent.

                <p>Any confirmed or suspected data security breaches should be reported promptly to the company&apos;s Data Protection Officer. The report should include full and accurate details of
                the incident, including who is reporting the incident and what classification of data is involved. Once a data breach has been reported, an initial assessment will be made to establish the severity of the breach. All data security breaches will be centrally logged on a Data Breach register to ensure appropriate oversight in the types and frequency of confirmed incidents for management and reporting purposes.</p>
